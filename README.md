Hi there!

My passion for technology and innovation has been nurtured through a Computer Science degree from the Federal University of Bahia, complemented by a transformative experience at the State University of New York, Plattsburgh, USA. As currently a Tech Lead and Full Stack Senior Software Developer at Oxeanbits, my focus extends beyond writing code. I strive for a good code quality and performance, aiming for solutions that are not only effective but also easily comprehensible to other team members and adaptable to future challenges. I firmly believe that coding is not about communicating with computers, it is about instructing computers and comunicating with humans.
